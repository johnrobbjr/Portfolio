    <p>
        My friend <a href="https://mikaelfloresamper.wordpress.com/">Miki</a> (a sculptor and all-around swell guy) had an idea. “he knew that valuable conversations about art sometimes occurred during classes or in casual discussion, but he felt that these conversations were rarer than they should be.
      </p>

        <p class="quote text-center">How could we facilitate better conversation within the art community?</p>

    <p>
        The idea was interesting, and eventually we built it out as a mobile web app structured as an events calendar with a focus on user comments.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ultimately the app flopped, but with our fail-fast mentality going into it, we were able to take it as a learning experience without using unnecessary time
        and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Budget:</b> Basically none. We each pitched in a small bit of personal money towards an SSL certificate, web hosting, and some promotional materials.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Experience:</b> I had never led a project like this before, but I drew on the experiences of others for help and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Time:</b> We gave ourselves about one month to go from concept to launch at the popular “Alloverstreet” gallery event.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        We went into the process with the goal of having an MVP out in a month, so we used quick and efficient techniques to have our product ready in time for
        quick validation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        We started with an extremely low fidelity "prototype" to figure out the basic functionalities of the application. I went to a gallery event with a small
        notebook, and wrote something down every time I felt compelled to use the app.
    </p>
        <a class="fancybox" href="img/critter/sketchbook.jpg">
          <img src="img/critter/sketchbook.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="lo-fi prototype">
        </a>
        <p class="caption">Prototype exercise (feat. unrelated sketch)</p>
    <p>
        From this we gained valuable insights as to when a person might use this during their gallery experience and how a person might interact with others while
        using it.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Design &amp; Development</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        First we tried to use an open-source forum software (phpBB) to develop the product, but it lacked the customization options necessary to create an
        easy-to-use web application.
      <a class="fancybox" href="img/critter/phpbb.jpg">
        <img src="img/critter/phpbb.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Critter on the phpBB platform">
      </a>
      <p class="caption">Critter running on the clunky phpBB platform</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        We then called on our friend <a href="https://github.com/Kramdar93">Mark</a>, a seasoned developer who agreed to jump on board the project. We then decided we’d build the mobile web app from scratch.
        Mark would handle the backend and databases (using Perl and SQL) while I would handle the front-end (HTML, CSS, and Twitter Bootstrap).
    </p>
    <p>
        Miki and I took to the whiteboard, and eventually came up with the app’s user flows and general layout.
    </p>
    <a class="fancybox" href="img/critter/whiteboard_1.jpg">

    </a>
    <p class="caption">Initial sketches</p>
    <p>
        For the logo we called up another friend with a strong visual design background, and iterated until we got to our fun little
        "critter" (derived from the word "critique"):

    </a>
    <p class="caption">Development of the Critter logo</p>
    <p>
        I used the sketches to create hi-fi mockups which I would reference during the development phase.
    </p>

      <img src="img/critter/hifi.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Hi-Fi Mockups">
    </a>
    <p class="caption">HiFi Comps</p>
    <p>
        <h3>Pre-Launch</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        As Mark and I were in the height of the development phase, Miki reached out to the founder of a popular Baltimore art news source, Bmore Art. We met with her over
        coffee, discussing our idea, possibilities of expansion, and what she could do to help us. We sent her a press release and <a href="http://www.bmoreart.com/2015/05/bmorearts-picks-baltimore-art-galleries-openings-and-events-may-5-9.html">it was posted to Bmore Art</a>, which many people at the launch mentioned they had seen
    </p>

        <img src="img/critter/bmore-art.png" alt="Press release on Bmore Art" class="img-responsive">
      </a>
        <p class="caption">Press Release published on Bmore Art</p>
    <p>
        We promoted the event on Facebook, and teamed up with Alloverstreet to have it sent out in their pre-event email. I also designed flyers to be posted around the venue and to be posted on social media leading up to the launch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Launch</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        We prepared our table outside of the Alloverstreet event with a purple tablecloth and matching balloons, as well as lollipops (as I said, low budget).
    </p>
    <a class="fancybox" href="img/critter/miki.jpg">
        <img src="img/critter/miki.jpg" class="img-responsive">
      </a>
        <p class="caption">Miki manning the booth</p>
    <p>
        As people filtered in, we asked them if they wanted a lollipop, and gave a small pitch about what Critter was and how they could use it. We talked to
        nearly 100 people, but a problem began to quickly emerge: many of the people we spoke to didn’t own a smartphone. This was not something we had considered while developing a mobile-first web app. A lot of people seemed interested in the idea, and we had 13 sign-ups by the end of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
        Four hours later, we broke down for the night, and not a single comment had been posted. There could have been many reasons as to why this occurred, but after
        much thought we decided the overwhelming disinterest was enough to discontinue the project.
    <!-- </p>

    <p> -->
        <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conducting more initial user research would have led to earlier invalidation of our original idea, which could have possibly led to new similar concepts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our launch was not extremely well-planned. Providing further motivation in some form for users to sign up and comment may have helped to drive usage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rather than treating the lack of interest as a failure, we could have looked into pivoting to find other places for growth.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>What Went Well</h2>
    </p>
      <p>
          We went into the project with a fail-fast mentality, and we were able to release an MVP within a month. Even if it failed, we were successful in our
          pursuit of learning.
      </p>
      <p>
          I was able to hone my HTML and CSS skills by applying them to a tangible project.
      </p>
      <p>
          Leading the full ideation-design-iteration-development process was incredibly interesting and I gained the confidence to go through a similar processin the future.
