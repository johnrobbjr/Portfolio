      <h1>Redesigning the Tissue Analytics Landing Page</h1>

    <p>
      We were just starting to get trail customers and this landing page was the gatekeeper between an interested user and a trail user, then hopefully a paying user.
    <br/>

    <br/>
    The website was generated from a template, and the content and interactions were not created with the user in mind.
    <br/>
    Our current landing page was not responsive, and by looking at our analytics, we were receiving 10% of our traffic through mobile devices. I determined that this was enough reason to warrant a responsive website. UX pitfalls were scattered around the website including dead-end flows and unnecessary redundancies.
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
    <b>Time:</b> I had about 3 weeks to complete the redesign, as no designer was scheduled to start once I left to pick up the project.
    <br/>
    <b>Team:</b> I was the only designer on the team, so I would use my team to get feedback on my designs and ask essential questions about the page’s users and purpose.
    <br/>
    <b>Experience:</b> I had not designed a full web landing page before, so research and competitive analysis would drive some design decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>
    After talking to a number of team members, I found out what users we would target for a free trail, and what information they would be looking for. I did research on competitor’s websites as well as information on designing landing pages with high conversion rates that I followed throughout the design process.
    <br/>
    First I completed some low-fidelity sketches for rapid iteration on the concept. Throughout this process I was asking for constant feedback and critiques from team-members to keep everyone involved.
    <br/>
    <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200"/>
    <br/>
    I then moved into medium-fidelity wireframes
    <br/>
    <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200"/>
    <br/>
    After a couple of weeks of iterations on the high-fidelity layer comps, I had a finished landing page for web completed.
    <br/>
    <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200"/>
    <br/>
    As this was my first full web design project, at this point I quickly learned the value of mobile first as I transitioned full-width comps into mobile- and tablet-optimized screens.
    <br/>
    <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200"/>
    <br/>
    The assets were then passed on to our front-end developer, and we kept open communication about what had to be done for proper implementation and clarifications on the assets.
    <br/>
    Two weeks later the website was up and running, and is live (with minor changes since I left the company) at <a href="https://www.tissue-analytics.com/">tissue-analytics.com</a>
    </p>

    <h3>What Went Well</h3>
    Communicating with the entire startup throughout the process not only lead to a substantial product, but also increased comradery between team members that didn’t typically get to work on mutual projects.
    <br/>
    The project unveiled flaws in the users workflow that were able to be solved with design solutions that I implemented in the new design.

    <h3>What I Would Do Differently</h3>
    Creating a customer journey map could have illustrated these problems to stakeholders, driving design solutions for the landing page as well as future projects.
    <br/>
    Developing personas earlier in with user interviews could have informed the design of the website.
    <br/>
    Using a mobile-first strategy, creating a simpler UI optimized for mobile devices then scaling them up would have saved time and effort.
