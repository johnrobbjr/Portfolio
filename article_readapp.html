	<p>
    For about a month this summer, I became an obsessive bookworm. During this time I found some pain points (finding a book to read, no updated apps to track books I’ve read) and delights (having great conversations about a book, sampling books from the library).
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to exercise my design skills and practice using Sketch, I began to design an app with this prompt in mind:
	</p>

  <p class="quote text-center">
    What would a great book-reading companion app look like?
  </p>



    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Time:</b> I was making this app during my personal time after work, so I didn't have much time or resources to dedicate to the project
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Scope:</b> An app like this could quickly get messy with too many features, the scope would have to be clearly defined.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
      Before designing the app, I captured what my current book reading experience was like, and where it could be improved by writing up rudimentary user journeys. I used these to look for delighters and pain points throughout the current reading experience and where my app might fit into the experience.
    </p>

  <a class="fancybox" href="img/readapp/journeys.png">
    <img src="img/readapp/journeys.png" class="img-responsive no-shadow" alt="Sketches of user journeys">
  </a>
  <p class="caption">Sketches of user journeys</p>

  <h2>Current Landscape</h2>
  <p>
    I looked to non-reading apps for inspiration and ideas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Spotify’s playlists and “Discover” feature are both great ways to explore new content</li>
    <li>Duolingo’s “Clubs” feed is great inspiration for a book club-style feature</li>
    <li>Runkeeper and Duolingo’s “Profile” pages show status and profile details</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <a class="fancybox" href="img/readapp/inspiration.png">

  </a>
  <p class="caption">Taking inspiration from Spotify playlists, Runkeeper profile, and Duolingo Clubs</p>

  <p>
    I spotted a few pain points that already exist in Goodreads (which would be a direct competitor):
  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Long onboarding flow</li>
      <li>Confusing information architecture</li>
      <li>No good ‘exploration’ experience to find new books</li>
      <li>Outdated visual design style</li>
    </ul>

    <a class="fancybox" href="img/readapp/goodreads-shots.png">
      <img src="img/readapp/goodreads-shots.png" class="img-responsive no-shadow" alt="Goodreads has a cumbersome onboarding flow and confusing architecture">

    <p class="caption">Goodreads has a cumbersome onboarding flow and confusing architecture</p>

    <!-- <h2>Exploring the problem space</h2>
    To
    Why do people choose to read a book?
    Prestige? (everyone’s talking about it)
    Critically acclaimed? (A friend’s recommendation)
    The time of year/mood?
    Time in their life (Self-help books)
    If they identify with the author (Thoreau)
    The author’s story (Between a rock and a hard place)
    A popular movie is out (Girl on a train)
    An author I enjoy (Cat’s Cradle)
    Book club (Persepolis)

    I looked back on books that I had read, and why I read them? -->

    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      I created a preliminary information architecture to help guide my designs and define a scope for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating this architecture helped me think through which features would logically appear where, and helped me to know which pages would be best to design first.
    </p>

    </a> -->

    <!-- <h2>Wireframes and Visual Design</h2> -->
    <h2>Now Reading: your reading companion</h2>

    <p>
      This is for ‘during’ the reading experience. The goal of comments would to get the benefit of an insightful conversation about a good book without attending a book club.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
      Spoilers here would be a huge issue, so I included a slider to only show comments relevant to that chapter. Commenters would be able to include a “spoiler alert.”
    </p>

    <p>
      By making a flexible book-card, people that pick up multiple books at once could also easily use the interface.
    </p> -->

    <h2>Explore: discovering new books</h2>

    <p>
      One of my major pain points is finding a new book to read, and no apps or websites have been able to assist me. After thinking about how people decide to read a new book, I realized books aren’t often chosen by the say they are often sorted (by genre or title), but rather by categories such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An interest in the author’s life story</li>
      <li>A recommendation from a friend</li>
      <li>Enjoying previous works by that author</li>
      <li>Reading it for a book club</li>
    </ul>

    <a class="fancybox" href="img/readapp/explore-wires.png">
      <img src="img/readapp/explore-wires.png" class="img-responsive no-shadow" alt="Explore wireframe iterations">
    </a>
    <p class="caption">"Explore" wireframe iterations</p>

    <p>
      For these reasons, I decided that using a playlist metaphor here would work best. Rather than being sorted only by genre, books can be selected from groups like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Summer short stories”</li>
      <li>“Top 10 horror stories of all time”</li>
      <li>“My saved books”</li>
      <li>“Bill Gates’ summer reading list”</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Sampling books like Snapchat: Immersive Playlist view</h2>

    <p>
      Another pain point I found while looking for a new book in the library was often that most of my selection process involved judging a book by its cover, picking it up, then reading the first few paragraphs. There is no digital equivalent of sampling books this quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      My question here was:
    </p>
    <p class="quote text-center">
      What if we had a way to sample books with the ephemerality and low commitment of the way users scan through Snapchat?
    </p>

    <a class="fancybox" href="img/readapp/snapchat-wires.png">
      <img src="img/readapp/snapchat-wires.png" class="img-responsive no-shadow" alt="Immersive playlist view wireframe iterations">
    </a>
    <p class="caption">"Immersive playlist view" wireframe iterations</p>

    <p>
      This is where the "Immersive playlist view" would come in. After tapping on a playlist, it would take you to the Immersive Playlist view. The user could read a few sentences/paragraphs of the first book or look through a summary of the book, its accolades, or user reviews.
    </p>

    <h2>What's next</h2>
    <p>
      I met with a fellow Bentley grad, <a href=”http://www.reedsnider.com/”>Reed</a> to get feedback on my ideas. A couple of takeaways from the conversation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a more visual experience, use the book covers more strongly</li>
      <li>Set more clear goals to avoid scope creep</li>
      <li>Create an interactive prototype</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I would do differently</h2>
    <p>
      Invest more time for informal research (possibly send out an informal survey to friends/family about their reading habits)
    </p>
    <p>
      Set more clear goals to address at the beginning of the project (personal goals, product goals, and user needs). A journey map might help establish these goals
    </p>
    <p>
      Use forums, design communities, and friends to get more feedback throughout the design process
    </p>

    <h2>What went well</h2>
    <p>
      Going through the full process of design iterations rather than jumping right to high-fidelity mocks saved me time and made for more appealing designs
    </p>
    <p>
      I became more familiar with Sketch as a tool for all stages of design
    </p>
    <p>
      I started to move towards creating more modern visual designs and and staying up-to-date with the latest design trends
