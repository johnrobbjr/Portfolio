  <p>
      The first project that I worked on at the <a href="http://www.bentley.edu/centers/user-experience-center">Bentley UXC</a> was the “Nursing Home Compare” tool on Medicare.gov. My team included my project manager (Elizabeth R.), a fellow graduate assistant (<a href="http://hilaryj.com/">Hilary J.</a>), and I. The UXC had been working with the Nursing Home Compare team since 2011, and this year they wanted to learn more about star ratings, quality measures, and previous test's findings.
  </p>
  <p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
      <b>Experience:</b> This was the first full usability test I worked on. I implemented knowledge from my Testing &amp; Assessment Programs class, my teammates’ expertise, and books I had read on usability testing.
  </p>
  <p>
      <b>Subject Matter:</b> Searching for nursing homes can be a very difficult time for many people. Since we were dealing with such an emotional topic, we needed to be careful in phrasing questions in our moderator’s guide to ensure the participants' comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
      <h2>Process</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
      Before preparing for the usability test, I aggregated the findings from past tests and recommendations to give the team a better grasp of what issues persisted over multiple usability tests and what issues had been resolved.
  </p>
  <p>
      Upon speaking with the client (we had weekly meetings throughout the testing process), we learned that their goals were focused around new “Quality Measures” and their star ratings. Based on the client’s goals and past testing, we established a concise list of research questions that would drive the usability study.
  </p>
  <p>
      <h3>Creating the Test</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
      For some findings from previous years that were not yet implemented, we wanted to test a possible solution so we could make a concrete recommendation. To
      do this, we decided to use a prototype to do A/B testing. I created the prototype using Axure that would mimic the current website
      with a few changes that we wanted to test.
  </p>
  <p>
      The client also wanted to implement <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/FederalPLGuidelines.pdf">Plain
      Language guidelines</a> throughout the website, and had some content that would need to be tested. Based on our research, we decided to have the participant read through a section of text
      within a prototype to themselves, and comment on anything they found confusing, misleading, or unclear. I found this topic interesting and later wrote a <a href="http://www.bentleyuxc.com/uxc-blog-editor/2016/3/11/m6m2ft6dqelm7h0g0i2t2t9qwav321">UXC blog post on language testing</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
      The final moderator’s guide contained 10 tasks for the 1.5 hour test. We arranged times and dates for testing and created a screener for the recruiting agency.
  </p>
  <p>
      <h3>Testing</h3>
  </p>
      <a class="fancybox" href="img/nhc/upstairs_lab.jpg">

      </a>
      <p class="caption">One of two usability labs at the Bentley UXC</p>
  <p>
      I moderated two of the sessions. These usability tests were unique in that the subject of study was very emotional for most participants. Although
      we were testing interface elements and the content of the website, participants were immediately drawn towards content that was relevant to their personal
      experiences. Paying attention to the participants’ body language and comfort levels was essential while keeping them on the right path to answer our
      research questions.
  </p>
  <p>
      During the sessions in which I was not moderating, I was taking rigorous notes regarding the session. I suggested that between sessions the team could
      review findings from the previous participant. We agreed to discuss the major themes of each session and to write key findings on post-it notes to get a visual representation of the tests.

    <p class="caption">Recording a session's major takeaways between tests</p>
  </p>
  <p>
      <h3>Analysis &amp; Report</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
      Once the test was completed, we realized that we had a large amount of data and were not sure how to go about tackling the report. Using the notes,
      post-its, and our research questions, we created a PowerPoint deck with a slide for each potential report item. We then went one-by-one finding and organizing the
      data surrounding each finding until we had a cohesive report.
  </p>
  <p>
      In order to help the implementation process, I created a worksheet of near-term recommendations that we predicted to be simple to implement. This would allow a developer to quickly find what changes should be made without sifting through the 50-slide deck meant for other stakeholders.
  </p>
  <p>
      <h2>What I Would Do Differently</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
      Although gathering key takeaways between sessions was a success, grouping the findings by their related research goal would have made for a smoother transition into analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
      <h2>What Went Well</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
      Incorporating Plain Language testing into our usability test was successful. We were able to find what parts of the language users did not understand and make concise suggestions based on our findings.
  </p>
  <p>
      The Post-it notes between sessions gave the team clear visuals of patterns and trends. We shared our success using this method with the rest of the UXC and I will continue to use this method for future tests.
  </p>
  <p>
      I learned an incredible amount about usability testing through this experience, including how to design a test, create a moderator’s guide, moderate a
      usability test, analyze test data, and create a usability test report.
